## Overview

**ScribblePrompt** is an interactive segmentation tool that enables users to segment *unseen* structures in medical images using clicks, bounding boxes *and scribbles*.

## Try ScribblePrompt

* Online Gradio Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/halleewong/ScribblePrompt

## Models

We provide two versions of ScribblePrompt: 

* **ScribblePrompt Unet** with an efficient fully-convolutional architecture  

* **ScribblePrompt SAM** based on the [Segment Anything Model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)

Both models have been trained with iterative **click, bounding box and scribble interactions** on a diverse collection of 65 medical imaging datasets with both real and synthetic labels. 

## Installation

You can install `scribbleprompt` in two ways:

* With pip

```
pip install git+https://github.com/halleewong/ScribblePrompt.git
```

* Manually: cloning it and installing dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/halleewong/ScribblePrompt
python -m pip install -r ./ScribblePrompt/requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$(relpath ./ScribblePrompt)"
```
See [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) for Segment Anything's dependencies.

## To Do

- [x] Release Gradio demo 
- [ ] Release model code and weights
- [ ] Release jupyter notebook tutorial
- [ ] Release scribble simulation code
- [ ] Release segmentation labels collected using ScribblePrompt

## Acknowledgements
